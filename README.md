# LGTV MacOS Companion
## Description
A macOS app to sync the power state of an LG WebOS TV with your Mac.

Inspired by the amazing [LGTVCompanion](https://github.com/JPersson77/LGTVCompanion) by JPersson77

And thank you to [LGTVLinuxCompanion](https://github.com/cali-95/LGTVLinuxCompanion) by cali-95, because Python is a lot easier to read than C++

This is an early beta, use at your own risk.

Written in Swift & SwiftUI

## Features
### In progress:
#### Basic Features:
- [ ] Detect sleep, wake, restart, and power off states of your mac
- [ ] Set the LG TV to the appropriate power state
- [ ] Set the LG TV to the appropriate HDMI input
- [ ] Set the HDMI input icon to 'PC' (allegedly helps with latency and processing on some versions of WebOS)

Both of these make sure your LG TV won't be turning on and off every time you open or close your laptop if it's not plugged into the display/dock
- [ ] Have the app work conditionally based on plugged in USB Devices
