# LGTV MacOS Companion
## Description
A macOS app to sync the power state of an LG WebOS TV with your Mac.

Inspired by the amazing [LGTVCompanion](https://github.com/JPersson77/LGTVCompanion) by JPersson77

And thank you to [LGTVLinuxCompanion](https://github.com/cali-95/LGTVLinuxCompanion) by cali-95, because Python is a lot easier to read than C++

This is an early beta, use at your own risk.

Written in Swift with SwiftUI and AppKit
