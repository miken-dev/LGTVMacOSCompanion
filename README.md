# LGTV MacOS Companion
## Description
A macOS app to sync the power state of an LG WebOS TV with your Mac.
Inspired by the amazing [LGTVCompanion](https://github.com/JPersson77/LGTVCompanion) by JPersson77
This is an early beta, use at your own risk.
Written in Swift & SwiftUI

## Features
### In progress:
#### Basic Features:
- [ ] Detect sleep, wake, restart, and power off states of your mac
- [ ] Set the LG TV to the appropriate power state
- [ ] Set the LG TV to the appropriate HDMI input
- [ ] Set the HDMI input icon to 'PC' (allegedly helps with latency and processing on some versions of WebOS)
#### MacBook specific features:
- [ ] Have the app work conditionally based on plugged in USB Devices
- [ ] Have the app work conditionally based on plugged in displays
 - Both of these make sure your LG TV won't be turning on and off every time you open or close your laptop if it's not plugged into the display/dock
